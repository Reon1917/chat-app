| Private Chat Rooms | ✅ Complete | Room-based permissions |
| Direct Messaging | ✅ Complete | Private conversations between users |
| Real-time Updates | ✅ Complete | Live updates via Supabase Realtime |
| Read Receipts | ✅ Complete | Show when messages are read |
| Typing Indicators | ✅ Complete | Show when users are typing |
| UI Components | ⚠️ In Progress | Needs styling refinements |
| Error Handling | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive error handling |
| Responsive Design | ⚠️ In Progress | Mobile optimization needed |
| Notifications | ❌ Planned | Future implementation |

## Database Structure

### Initial Migration Approach

We previously used a sequence of migration files to build the database incrementally:

1. **Base Schema** (01_base_schema.sql)
   - Created basic `messages` and `profiles` tables
   - Set up row-level security
   - Added user profile trigger

2. **Chat Rooms** (02_chat_rooms.sql)
   - Added `rooms` and `room_members` tables
   - Implemented room-based permissions
   - Updated message tables with room association

3. **Message Features** (03_message_features.sql)
   - Added read receipts
   - Added typing indicators
   - Set up related security policies

4. **Direct Messaging** (04_direct_messaging.sql)
   - Created direct conversation system
   - Added helper functions for conversation management
   - Implemented conversation-based permissions

5. **Policy Fixes** (05_fix_recursive_policy.sql)
   - Attempted to fix infinite recursion issues in policies

### New Clean-Slate Approach

Due to persistent recursive policy issues, we've created a comprehensive solution:

- **reset_and_rebuild.sql**: A single script that:
  1. Drops all existing tables and functions in the correct dependency order
  2. Rebuilds the entire database schema with non-recursive policies
  3. Properly sequences table creation to avoid circular references
  4. Uses `EXISTS` clauses instead of subqueries for all policies
  5. Implements proper permissions while avoiding any recursive references

This approach addresses the root cause of the infinite recursion problems rather than just treating symptoms.

## Critical Issues & Solutions

### Root Cause of Infinite Recursion in Policies

**Problem:** The database was experiencing infinite recursion errors in policies for both `room_members` and `rooms` tables.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The original policies were creating circular references:

1. When checking if a user could view a room, it would check if they were a member
2. When checking if a user could view a room_member record, it would check if they were a member of that room
3. This created a cycle where each policy depended on the other

**Solution Principles:**

1. **Direct Access First**: When possible, use direct conditions (`user_id = auth.uid()`) instead of lookups
2. **Avoid Self-Reference**: Never have a policy that references rows from its own table
3. **Use EXISTS Instead of IN**: Replace `IN (subquery)` with `EXISTS (correlated subquery)`
4. **Join-Based Approach**: Use explicit joins for complex permission checks
5. **Proper Table Creation Order**: Create tables in the right order to avoid circular references

### Example of Fixed Policy:

Old (recursive):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Private rooms are viewable only by members" 
ON public.rooms FOR SELECT 
USING (
  is_private = false OR 
  id IN (SELECT room_id FROM public.room_members WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
);
```

New (non-recursive):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view private rooms they are members of" 
ON public.rooms FOR SELECT 
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.room_members 
    WHERE room_members.room_id = rooms.id 
    AND room_members.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

### Other Fixed Issues

1. **TypeError in DirectMessage Component**
   - Added Zod schema validation for all data types
   - Created a comprehensive error handling utility
   - Improved input validation for UUID fields
   - Added specific handling for recurring errors

2. **Improved Policy Organization**
   - Split policies into logical groups by table and purpose
   - Added clear comments explaining policy intent
   - Used consistent naming conventions

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks (Next Sprint)

1. **Database Stability**
   - [x] Fix recursive policy issues (completed)
   - [ ] Add data migration script to preserve existing data
   - [ ] Add database tests to verify policy correctness

2. **UI Improvements**
   - [ ] Refine mobile responsiveness
   - [ ] Add loading states and animations
   - [ ] Improve message styling

3. **Feature Refinements**

   - [ ] Add user online status indicators
   - [ ] Implement message search

### Long-term Goals

1. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Push notifications
   - [ ] File sharing and attachments
   - [ ] Voice/video calling

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - [ ] Implement message pagination
   - [ ] Cache frequently accessed data
